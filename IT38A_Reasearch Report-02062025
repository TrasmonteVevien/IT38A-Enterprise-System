A. Research title: "Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations"

b. Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation "PalFinger"  

    
     b.1. company overview:
     Palfinger is one of a leading manufacturer of innovative crane and lifting solutions. To improve the global collaboration and enhancing the efficiency in creating projects, the company decided to implement an system, enterprise system. In which, the goal is to improve data transparency, and better communication across teams.

     b.2. implementation process 
     In 2022, Palfinger adopted Smartsheet, a workflow and project management tool. The system is flexible, ease of use, and has a ability to be customized without the need for external developers. Palfinger gradually rolled out the system, ensuring teams were trained and the software was adapted to specific workflows.

     b.3. Key success factors
     -User-Friendy Interface: Employees can quickly adapt to Smartsheet due to its spreadsheet like.
     -Customization: No-code automation allowed teams to tailor the system to their needs.
     -Collaboration: Improved communication and data sharing.
     -Standardized Reporting: Provide clear visibility into ongoing projects and progress.

     b.4. outcomes & impact
     The implementation led to improved the project management, reduced email-traffic, and fewer meetings. Team had real-time visibility into project status, leading to better decision making and smooth execution of initiatives.


c. Case Study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation "Hershey's" 


     c.1. company overview:
     Hershey is a major chocolate manufacturer, decided to implement an enterprise system in year 1996 to upgrade it's outdated IT infrastructure and prepare for the Y2K transition. The company aimed to integrate it's ERP, supply chain management (SCM), and customer relationship management (CRM) systems into one unified platform.

     c.2. implementation process & challenges
     Hershey choose SAP's/3 ERP, Manugistics' SCM, and Siebe's CRM for integration. While experts recommended a 48 months of implementation timeline. However, the company insisted to implement it within 30 months to meet the Y2K deadline. The aggressive schedule led to rushed testing and inadequate preparation. The system failures prevented the company from processing $100 million worth of orders despite having the inventory in stock.

     c.3. Key failure factors
     -Unrealistic Timeline: Short schedule can led to incomplete testing.
     -Insufficient Testing: Rushed implementation left undetected bugs in the system.
     -Poor Scheduling: Lunching the system during peak sales resulted a severe disruptions.

     c.4. outcomes & consequences
     Failed implementation caused a 19% drop in quarterly profits and an 8% decline in stock price. The reputation of the company took a hit ,and the company struggled to fulfill their customers order during sales periods.


d. Comparative analysis:

     d.1. Similarities & Differences 

     Aspect                       Palfinger(Success)                                      Hershey's (Failure)
 
a.Implementation Timeline: Flexible, allowing for gradual rollout and adaptation.     Rushed, cutting implementation time from 48 months to 30. 
b.Testing Procedures: Thorough testing and customization before full deployment.      Insufficient testing due to time constraints. 
c.Go-Live Scheduling: Implemented during a manageable period, avoiding peak times.    Launched during peak sales season, leading to disruptions. 
d.User Adoption: User-friendly system with proper training.                          Employees were not adequately trained before launch. 
e.Outcomes: Improved efficiency, better collaboration, and streamlined processes.    System failures, financial losses, and reputational damage. 

     d.2. Critical Success vs. Failure Factors
    
     Success Factors (Palfinger):                                              

     Standardized Processes: Ensured accurate and complete data.  
     Low-Code Platform: Faster development, lower costs.  
     Thorough Testing: Validated system before full deployment.  
     
     Failure Factors (Hershey's):

     Rushed Implementation: Compressed timeline led to poor preparation.  
     Inadequate Testing:  Skipped critical testing phases. 
     Poor Timing: Launched system during peak sales period. 


     d.3. Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned include the following questions:
            1. What did the successful case do right?
            Palfinger selected a system that was easy to use and customize, allowed time gradual adoption and testing
,and Implementation was scheduled to avoid business disruptions.
            2. What went wrong in the failed case?
            Hershey's rushed the implementation to meet the arbitrary due, the testing was insufficient that leads to undetected bugs that cause system failures, the system went live at worst possible time-during peak sales.
            3. How can future implementations avoid similar failures?
            Follow the realistic timeline, ensure enough time for testing, avoid lunching new system during peak operational periods, provide adequate training to employees before deploying.

 e. Insights & recommendations
     e.1. Best Practices for Successful Enterprise System Implementation
    Select a user-friendly system for successful enterprise system implementation, ensure a phased rollout with adequate testing ang training, involve the key stakeholders in planning and adoption process.
     e.2. Strategies to Avoid Failure
    Dont rush the implementation due, schedule the go-live phase to minimize risks, conduct system checking before deployment. 
     e.3. Future Research Opportunities
    Explore AI-driven ERP solutions for improvement efficiency, study additional case studies to identify common trends, investigate how small businesses implement a system with a limited resources.
